# Cell Coverage by Mysingtel Dart Data

## Purpose:
This is an analysis using Sinagapore MySingtel Dart data matched with LBS data.

We want to get some insights for the footfall distribution among different period of time for each cell.

## Description: 
The `data` folder contains matched data for one week. `/data/weekday` contains the data for weekdays and `/data/weekend` is the data for weekends.

In the jupyter notebook, you can choose to load one day or multiple days' data, sort the cell towers by the number of matched records they have and plot the DART points. 

Do note: I use my personal Google API token to plot the map. Please use your own token if you can.
